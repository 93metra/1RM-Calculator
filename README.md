# One-Rep Max Calculator

## 📌 Description

1RM Calculator is a web application that helps users calculate their one-rep max (1RM) in key exercises like deadlift, squat, and bench press. This tool is designed for effective training planning, allowing users to determine their maximum strength and percentage-based training weights.

## ⚠️ Known Issue with GitHub Pages

There is currently a known issue when running the app on GitHub Pages. The styles for the **.modalOverlay** class are not being applied correctly, which causes the layout of the modal window to appear broken. However, when running the app locally, everything works as expected.

This issue seems to be related to how GitHub Pages handles CSS files or class names. Unfortunately, I have not been able to resolve this bug yet. If you encounter this issue while using the app on GitHub Pages, please note that it does not affect the core functionality of the calculator, only the appearance of the modal window.

For now, if you want to experience the app without this issue, you can clone the repository and run it locally.

Feel free to let me know if you need further assistance or additional changes!
